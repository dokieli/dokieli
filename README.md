There is no root, authority, or centralisation here. Control yourself!

dokieli is a decentralised article authoring, annotation, and social
notification tool which works from Web browsers. It is built with the
following principles in mind: freedom of expression, decentralisation,
interoperability.

It can be used as a:
* single-page application - open any dokieli article
* browser extension - import this repository in your Web browser or install Web
Extension from [Add-ons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dokieli/)
or [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ddmhaonbhodhgkaljpjlglodncddalid)

## Documentation
* For brave developers and authors: the canonical [documentation](https://dokie.li/docs)
explains dokieli's principles, architectural and design patterns.
* For academics: [Decentralised Authoring, Annotations and Notifications for a Read-Write-Web with dokieli](http://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww)


## Features
* In-browser document authoring and formatting, and semantic enrichments (RDFa annotations)
* Content negotiation is possible for RDFa, Turtle, JSON-LD, RDF/XML.
* Information is represented and retrieved following the Linked Data design principles
* Employs [WebID](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/identity/), [WebID+TLS](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/), [Web Access Control](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl)/ACL and personal online datastore where applicable (compliant with [Linked Data Platform](http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) and [Solid](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec) servers)
* Uses author's information from their online profile (WebID)
* Creation of new documents from any existing dokieli document - part of *self-replication*
* Save document and its dependencies to a new location (anywhere on the Web given access) - part of *self-replication*
* Implements versioning, has the notion of immutable resources, and [Memento](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089) based resource management
* Implements the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) client (read/write from/to profile's outbox)
* Open and edit (HTML+RDFa) URLs
* Uses W3C [Web Annotation Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) and [Activity Streams 2.0 vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary)
* Annotations (e.g., replies, peer-reviews, liking, resharing, bookmarking)
* Inbox notifications for annotations and social sharing (implements W3C [Linked Data Notifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/))
* Assign license (e.g., [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/)) to the contributions/annotations
* Uses [schema.org](http://schema.org/), [SPAR Ontologies](http://www.sparontologies.net/), [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/)
* Assignment of URI fragments (to whatever is of interest) so that other resources on the Web can reference
* Embedding data blocks, e.g., Turtle, N-Triples, JSON-LD, TriG (Nanopublications)
* Embedding of media objects, tables, and interactions
* Automated references and citations (retrieves and reuses structured information)
* Insertion of table of contents, figures, tables, abbreviations
* Drag and drop to reorganize the document's sections and table of contents
* In-browser local storage, and document exporting
* Document metadata
* Views for screen and print (e.g., ACM, LNCS) - yes, you can output to a *paper user interface*: PDF
* .. and [many more on the way](https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli/issues/)

## Examples

See the growing list of [examples in the
wild](https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli/wiki#examples-in-the-wild). Add
the URLs of your articles or interactions to the list.

This repository is published and accessible from
[https://dokie.li/](https://dokie.li/). dokie.li is intended to demo and
exemplify what we can do with this technology. You are welcome to use and
experiment with dokieli there, or anywhere else you come across a dokieli
document.

For the scholars among us, see the authoring guidelines below. View the ACM
guidelines using the LNCS typographical rules, and vice versa (see the menu) ;)
* [ACM SIG Proceedings Paper](https://dokie.li/acm-sigproc-sp)
* [LNCS Author Guidelines](https://dokie.li/lncs-splnproc)


## Dependencies
* Read: client either loads local HTML files or fetches remote URLs, in that case
the host sends HTML etc. All content is accessible at minimum from a text-browser
* Local write: Web browser with JavaScript enabled (use export or local storage)
* Remote write and access control: above plus WebID and personal online storage

These libraries *optional* when dokieli is used as single-page application:

* [SimpleRDF](https://github.com/nicola/simplerdf) (MIT License) used for RDF
* [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) (SIL OFL 1.1 / MIT License)
* [MediumEditor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) (MIT License)


## Development
* See the [dokieli documentation](https://dokie.li/docs). Quick dev:
```
git clone https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli
cd dokieli

# Creates scripts/do.js.
npm install; npm run build

# Watch and update files
npm run watch

```
